Project Description

When collecting GIS data, models, etc. what metadata do you need to capture to enable semantic searching?

The Texas Disaster Information System aims to collect data of various types along with models for major weather-related hazards (floods, fires, snowpocalypses, etc.) and enable users at many levels to find and access those tools. Using an ontological framework, we are working on mapping metadata fields to facilitate model integration

The goal of our project is to explore using OntoSoft and a dataset repository to understand the metadata required to enable machine-learning assisted searching. Specifically, we plan to create software/model entries in OntoSoft and a separate database of climate data to develop understanding of what metadata is needed to enable semantic searching of available software and datasets.
